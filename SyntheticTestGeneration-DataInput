Structured Approach to Gather Inputs
1. Data Domain

    Industry: Food & Hospitality
    Use Case: Managing and analysing restaurant reservations to optimize table bookings, track customer preferences, and improve the dining experience.

2. Data Structure

    Format: Typically relational databases (SQL) for structured data or NoSQL (MongoDB) for flexible storage; JSON may be used if data is consumed by APIs.
    Schema: Common tables or collections may include Restaurants, Customers, Reservations, Tables, Payments, and Reviews.

3. Data Types and Fields

    Data Types:
        String: Restaurant ID, customer name, reservation ID, table ID, booking status
        Integer/Float: Number of guests, rating, table capacity, total bill amount
        Date/Timestamp: Reservation date, check-in time, check-out time, review timestamp

    Fields:

        Restaurant-related:
            Restaurant ID (Unique identifier)
            Restaurant name
            Cuisine type (e.g., Italian, Indian, Chinese)

            Total seating capacity

        Customer-related:
            Customer ID
            Customer name
            Phone number
            Email address
            Loyalty points (if applicable)
            Special preferences (e.g., vegetarian, non-smoking area, window seating)

        Reservation-related:
            Reservation ID
            Restaurant ID (Foreign key linking to Restaurants)
            Customer ID (Foreign key linking to Customers)
            Table ID (Foreign key linking to Tables)
            Number of guests
            Booking status (e.g., Confirmed, Cancelled, No-show, Completed)
            Reservation date & time
            Check-in timestamp
            Check-out timestamp
            Special requests (e.g., birthday celebration, high chair for kids)

        Table-related:
            Table ID
            Restaurant ID (Foreign key linking to Restaurants)
            Table number
            Table capacity (e.g., 2-seater, 4-seater, 6-seater)
            Availability status (e.g., Available, Reserved, Occupied)

        Payment-related:
            Payment ID
            Reservation ID (Foreign key linking to Reservations)
            Payment method (e.g., Credit Card, UPI, Cash)
            Total bill amount
            Transaction status (e.g., Successful, Failed, Pending)

        Reviews and Ratings:
            Review ID
            Customer ID
            Restaurant ID
            Rating (e.g., 1-5)
            Review comment
            Review timestamp

        Patterns:
            Use of standardized formats for phone numbers, email addresses, timestamps, and payment transaction IDs.

4. Data Volume and Variety

    Volume: High frequency, with thousands of bookings, payments, and reviews per day reflecting real-time restaurant reservations.
    Variety:
        Diverse data reflecting different restaurant cuisines, table configurations, and peak booking hours
        Variability in customer preferences, special requests, and payment options

5. Data Relationships and Constraints

    Relationships:
        Restaurant ID acts as a foreign key in Reservations, Tables, and Reviews to associate data with specific restaurants.
        Customer ID links to Reservations, Payments, and Reviews to track booking history and feedback.
        Reservation ID in Reservations is linked to Payments for tracking transaction status.
    Constraints:
        Unique constraints on fields such as Restaurant ID, Reservation ID, Table ID, Payment ID, Customer ID.
        Validation rules to ensure accurate table availability, booking time management, and rating scales (1-5).

6. Data Quality and Realism

    Realism:
        Data should reflect actual restaurant booking conditions, including peak hours, cancellation patterns, table availability, and reservation trends.
    Quality Standards:
        Ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness, particularly in customer reservations, restaurant operating hours, and payment records.

7. Additional Requirements

    Compatibility:
        Data should integrate seamlessly with restaurant management systems, online booking platforms, CRM tools, and analytics dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
        Support for API-based data consumption to enable real-time booking status updates, notifications, and payment processing.
